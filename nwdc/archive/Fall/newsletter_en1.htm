It is important therefore that you come prepared and so we recommend that in addition to bringing <strong>sun block</strong> you also bring <strong>clothes for cool, windy and wet weather (including a rain jacket)</strong>. The sun at the Temple site is strong so please <strong>bring a hat</strong>. <strong>Umbrellas can provide both protection from sun as well as rain! </strong></font></font></p>
